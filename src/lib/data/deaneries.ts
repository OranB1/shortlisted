// Full UK postgraduate deanery/Local Office list for onboarding's general "which deanery" question.
// Not the same list as PROGRAMME_REGIONS (src/lib/data/region-mapping.ts) — that one is scoped to
// what the IMT regional-competitiveness dataset can actually differentiate (single "Scotland"
// bucket), and stays as-is so the likelihood tool's region selector matches its real data. This
// list is for general profile accuracy and includes Scotland's 4 real deanery regions.
//
// England's 13 Local Offices (NHS England specialty recruitment grouping) and Wales/Northern
// Ireland (each a single unified deanery — HEIW/Wales Deanery, NIMDTA) were already correct.
// Scotland was the actual gap: NHS Education for Scotland (NES) runs 4 regional deaneries, not one.
